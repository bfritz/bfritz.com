Welcome to [bfritz.com].  I'm Brad.

Occasionally I daydream about throwing all my devices into the nearest
lake.  _Normally_, though, I enjoy shipping software and gluing
together open source tools into useful systems.  Experience teaches me
the only way to _really_ understand those systems is to instrument and
observe themâ€”most usefully in production.

Much of my recent professional work is on the JVM in Java and Kotlin.
I also organized [Indy Scala] for many years with the help of [Ross]
and [others].  Looking to the future, though, it is exciting to watch
the Go and Rust communities grow and I hope to use one or both in
upcoming client work.

My favorite projects are the ones where my team is working closely
with customers and iterating quickly.  Where I am both teaching and
learning.  And where I'm a member of the team that keeps production
healthy and customers happy.
