Welcome to bfritz.com.  I'm Brad.

Occasionally I daydream about throwing all my devices into the
nearest lake.  _Normally_, though, I enjoy shipping software, gluing
together open source tools into useful systems, and learning more
about embedded electronics.

Much of my recent professional work is on the JVM in Java and Kotlin.
I also helped organize [Indy Scala] for many years.  It has been
exciting to watch the Go and Rust communities grow.  I hope to use one
or both of those languages more often in upcoming client work.

My favorite projects are the ones where my team is working closely
with customers and iterating quickly.  Where I am both teaching and
learning.  And where I'm a member of the team that keeps production
healthy.
